Plots and residual analysis of football PSI's
 
This contains the code to make run three statistical models and make a few different charts using the pre-game and halftime PSI readings from the Patriots Colts AFC championship game. 

The first plot shows the PSI readings for gauge A and B, using the labels indicated by the game's referee. 

The second plot shows the residual plot of the Wells Report's final linear mixed effects model, a model that was used to conclude that there was a statistically significant difference in the deflation levels of the Patriots and Colts footballs at halftime.

The third plot plays with the estimated pre-game readings to highlight how reliant the model's pvalue is on the pre-game values.
